<h1> Week 10 - Project based experiments ! </h1>
<p>
  In this week, I created experiments based on my project. I am building web application that will facilitate users 
    to post their needs, amount of money they need. Interested people can donate money to them. It is pretty much like
    Kickstarter, but for social cause ! I have decide to name this project as UpLifter , as it will uplift the 
    ignored section of society.

    I experimented on creating home page, contact page. I added a new section in registration form for the recipient. 
    This data will be stored on server and data for all recipients can be seen. No login is required for this. But 
    this is just a summary kind of page. I have made each row clickable so that if you click on any of the 
    details are shown.
