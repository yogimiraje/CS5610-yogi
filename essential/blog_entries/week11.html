<h1> Week 11 - Working on the project ! </h1>
<p>
  In this week, I continued to work on my project. I worked on saving user registration information into the database. I 
 am using MongoDb and Mongoose for this. I also fixed a bug whcih will now enable users to get into their profile 
    directly after registration. I also added the feature of profile picture. Uploading picture is optional. I have also made 
    sure that a default image is displayed when user does not upload his/her profile picture. I am storing the image 
    as binary string into database. I fixed a bug that was showing login screen for public pages after refresh.
    You may have look at the project accessing below link. Although only a few features are working now.
