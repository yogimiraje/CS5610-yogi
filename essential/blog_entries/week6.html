<h1> Week 6 - Exploring Angular JS Routing </h1>
<p>   
    This week I tried to explore Angular JS routing by creating different controllers, services , sharing the data between 
    pages through services. I added many new features to the last week's petition filing application.
    Some of them are : profile creation, login, logout functionality, login validation, 
    user-specific petition updating.

       These experiments helped me to understand the MVC architecture of Angular JS better. Although there are many other 
         frameworks that implement MVC by asking you to split your app into MVC components, then require you to write code 
        to string them up together again. That’s a lot of work. Angular implements MVC by asking you to split your app into 
        MVC components, then just let Angular do the rest. Angular manages your components for you and also serves as the
         pipeline that connects them.
