<h1> Week 7 - Server side scripting - with Node.js and Express </h1>
<p>   
    I have been working on client-side applications for last a few weeks.
    Now it's time to dive into server side scripting ! This week I learnt how to display a simple message , a simple
    static html and an angular js application on the node.js server. 
    </p>
    <p> These experiments helped me to get better insight into the server-side scripting. I also learnt a bit about RESTful web service. 
    To learn more about node.js and express, I read some  material on web and came across a few things which made my understanding 
    about these server-side technology clear.

        Node.js really is just another context: it allows you to run JavaScript code in the backend, outside a browser.

        In order to execute the JavaScript you intend to run in the backend, it needs to be interpreted and, well, executed. This is what Node.js does, by making use of Google's V8 VM, the same runtime environment for JavaScript that Google Chrome uses.

        Plus, Node.js ships with a lot of useful modules, so you don't have to write everything from scratch, like for example something that outputs a string on the console.
