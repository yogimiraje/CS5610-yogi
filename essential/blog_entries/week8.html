<h1> Week 8 - Spring Break ! </h1>
<p>   
    This week is spring Break. In the break I have not performed any experiments, but I decided to learn a few things. 
    I took Web Development because most of my work experience was in back-end systems and I had no exposure to web technologies.
    I learnt about web services, RESTful web services, SOAP. I also went through Prof. Jose's video lectures once again 
    as they are very helpful not only to learn the topic but also to understand best practices for web programming.

        I also prepared a draft layout of a few web pages for the project. Before the spring break, I discussed project idea with 
        Prof. Jose and worked on some of the suggestions he gave. Next week I will do some experiments on Mongo DB, but mostly 
        will focus on the project related experiments.
