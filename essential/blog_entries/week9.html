<h1> Week 9 - Passporting your application ! </h1>
<p>
  In this week, I learned about how to authenticate the user using passport js. 
    Passport is authentication middleware for Node. It is designed to serve a singular purpose: authenticate requests. 
    When writing modules, encapsulation is a virtue, so Passport delegates all other functionality to the application. 
    This separation of concerns keeps code clean and maintainable, and makes Passport extremely easy to integrate into an
    application.

    I experimented on adding login , logout functionality. I also learnt about session management using cookies.
    Passport js makes it very easy and with minimal code you can keep track of the current session. I also added 
    registration feature to the application. I validated most of the frequently occuring login error scenarios.
