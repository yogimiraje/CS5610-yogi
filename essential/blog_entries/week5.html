<h1> Week 5 - Angular JS and jQuery</h1>
<p>
    This week I performed three  experiments with Angular JS. Also, I felt that I am not yet comfortable with jQuery syntax and
    DOM manipulation using jQuery , so I decided to do a couple of experiments using jQuery as well.

    Angular JS provides the feature  to create multi-page applications without a round-trip to server. This is
    very useful feature if you want to save unnecessary overhead caused by server access.  It is useful when there is requirement
    to store data locally and update it to server once user wish to. To demonstrate this, I created  a small application
    where user can file the online petitions. Each time user adds a petition it is stored locally
    and view page is updated with the petitin filed.

    I also performed a couple of jQuery experiments for DOM manipulation. jQuery is cross platform Java script library used
    on client side modelling. The advantage of using jQuery over java script is that, it is compatible with all the browsers
    so we don't need to write browser specific code. jQuery is more easy to implement than Javascript.
    I experimented on the some of jQuery DOM manipulation methods such as hide(), show(), addClass(),removeClass().
